# DataBase-Project
This repository contains a project, which is made to show my skills in working with various databases, such as User Defaults, Realm and CoreData. In this project I made two simple ToDo apps, with Realm and CoreData, and two textFields which store input information using UserDefaults. Also, I made a simple weather app, with current and 7-day forecast information, which is stored using Realm.
